-n
    The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker's normal speed.-n    -n    A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.-n    -n    Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly.  The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds.  If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely.  If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.-n    -n    You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air.  You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see page 74) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

    @Alarm@ sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.-n    -n    Mental @Alarm@: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental "ping" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.-n    -n    Audible @Alarm@: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing.-n    -n    Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm.-n    -n    @Alarm@ can be made permanent with a permanency spell.-n    -n    Arcane Focus: A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire.

Target: You
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
-n
    You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form (such as humanoid or magical beast).  The new form must be within one size category of your normal size.  The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level.  You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.  You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.-n    -n    You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).-n    -n    If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.-n    -n    You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.-n    -n    You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.-n    -n    You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.  Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.  You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.-n    -n    You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind.  The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.-n    -n    When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.  Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.

Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: None or Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    You discern all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures or objects.  Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action.  In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges).  In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.-n    -n    An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires.  If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it.  An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze dweomer spells for 24 hours.-n    -n    Analyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on artifacts).-n    -n    Focus: A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The gemstone must be worth at least 1,500 gp.

Animal Growth
Transmutation
Level: Ranger 4, Druid 5, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: Up to one animal (Gargantuan or smaller) per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight.  This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide.  The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.-n    -n    The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.-n    -n    If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.  If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.-n    -n    All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.-n    -n    The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.-n    -n    Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.

Animal Messenger
Enchantment(Compulsion)[Mind-Affecting]
Level: Ranger 1, Bard 2, Druid 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One Tiny animal
Duration: One day/level
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate.  The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies.  The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.-n    -n    Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.  It advances and awaits your bidding.  You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain).  The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own.  You can attach some small item or note to the messenger.  The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.-n    -n    During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.  Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.  The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example).-n    -n    Material Component: A morsel of food the animal likes.

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
-n
    As polymorph, except you polymorph up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures.  All creatures must take the same kind of animal form; for example, you can't turn one subject into a hawk and another into a dire wolf.  Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients.  In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.  The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to the subject's HD or your caster level, whichever is lower, to a maximum of 20 HD at 20th level.

Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you.  Only a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this spell.  Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate.  The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.  For example, if Vadania affects 7 HD worth of animals and there are several 2 HD wolves within close range, only the three closest wolves are affected.-n    -n    A magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to attack or guard is not.

    This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken commands.-n    The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place.-n    They remain animated until they are destroyed.-n    (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).-n    Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of animate dead.-n    (The desecrate spell doubles this limit; see page 218).-n    The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely.-n    No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level.-n    If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.-n    (You choose which creatures are released).-n    If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.-n    Skeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton.-n    The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible.-n    If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.-n    The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.-n    The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons.-n    Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.-n    The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie.-n    The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.-n    The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies.-n    Material Component: You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate.-n    The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells.

    You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life.-n    Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category.-n    You may animate one Large or smaller plant (such as a tree), or an equivalent number of larger plants, per three caster levels.-n    A Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight.-n    You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.-n    Use the statistics for animated objects found in the Monster Manual, except that plants smaller than Large don't have hardness unless the DM rules otherwise for a given case.-n    Animate plants cannot affect plant creatures (such as treants), nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material (such as a cotton tunic or hempen rope).-n    @Entangle@: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area.-n    This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an entangle spell.-n    Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled.-n    This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.

Animate Rope

Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    You can animate a nonliving ropelike object, such as string, yarn, cord, line, rope, or even a cable. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.-n    -n    The possible commands are "coil" (form a neat, coiled stack), "coil and knot", "loop", "loop and knot", "tie and knot", and the opposites of all of the above ("uncoil", and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.-n    -n    The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it--it does not snake outward--so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inchdiameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.-n    -n    The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.-n    -n    This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.-n    -n    The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.

    An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you.-n    The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.-n    Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.-n    An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.-n    A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field.-n    Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration.-n    Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field.-n    They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away.-n    Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature.-n    If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out.-n    (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result).-n    A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles.-n    Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that).-n    The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures).-n    Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.-n    These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.-n    Dispel magic does not remove the field.-n    Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other.-n    Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions).-n    Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.-n    (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more about artifacts).-n    Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.-n    Arcane Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.

-n
    This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you.-n    The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.-n    You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight.-n    An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219).-n    If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each.-n    (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect).-n    If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.-n    In some cases, arcane sight may give a deceptively low reading--for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment.-n    Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

    By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.-n    You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.-n    These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times.-n    If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.-n    You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation.-n    The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.-n    Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will.-n    To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.-n    While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord.-n    If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.-n    Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).-n    When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.-n    If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.-n    Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.-n    You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely.-n    Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them.-n    The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).-n    Material Component: A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.

Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject.-n    The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds.-n    If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you.-n    However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden.-n    Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf.-n    @Atonement@ may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.-n    Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.-n    Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.-n    Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid.-n    If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession.-n    If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.-n    Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours.-n    The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process.-n    Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment.-n    No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment.-n    This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.-n    Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.-n    Note:Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs).-n    This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.-n    Material Component: Burning incense.-n    Focus: In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.-n    XP Cost:When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, the cost to you is 500 XP per casting (see above).

Duration: Instantaneous
-n
    An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.-n    For example, if a character is considering destroying a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury might determine whether that act is a good idea.-n    The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly.-n    The DM may determine that a question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success.-n    If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:-n    -n    * Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).-n    -n    * Woe (for bad results).-n    -n    * Weal and woe (for both).-n    -n    * Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).-n    -n    If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result.-n    A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.-n    The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result.-n    Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.-n    All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.-n    Material Component: Incense worth at least 25 gp.-n    Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value.

-n
    A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature.-n    The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.-n    You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.-n    For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1.-n    For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell.-n    Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant.-n    Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts.-n    All binding spells are dismissible.-n    Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.-n    These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.-n    The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.-n    Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify.-n    For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.-n    Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.-n    Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.-n    If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap.-n    If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.-n    If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.-n    The binding spell has six versions.-n    Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.-n    Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you.-n    The duration is one year per caster level.-n    The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.-n    Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level.-n    The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age.-n    This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist.-n    Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.-n    Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level.-n    Reduce the save DC by 2.-n    Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means.-n    The effect is permanent.-n    Reduce the save DC by 3.-n    Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face.-n    It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose.-n    The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities.-n    The binding is permanent.-n    The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age.-n    Reduce the save DC by 4.-n    Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.-n    The binding is permanent.-n    The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.-n    Reduce the save DC by 4.-n    You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen's disjunction affects it normally.-n    A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.-n    Components: The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used.-n    These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.-n    In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.

Target: Weapon touched
Duration: 1 min./level

-n
    This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes.-n    The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus).-n    The weapon also becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, particularly evil outsiders.-n    (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have).-n    Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.-n    In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit.-n    This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
-n
    Like a blink dog (see the Monster Manual), you "blink" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.-n    You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.-n    @Blink@ing has several effects, as follows.-n    Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible.-n    If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).-n    If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.-n    (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance).-n    Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.-n    Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures.-n    Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.-n    While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).-n    You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.-n    You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.-n    While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects.-n    For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material.-n    If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.-n    You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material).-n    Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.-n    You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.-n    For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.-n    An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down.-n    As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.-n    An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial.-n    Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.-n    Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally.-n    Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.-n    An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.-n    Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack.-n    Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

    The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering.-n    This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).-n    A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does.-n    Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own; see page 151).

Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses.-n    Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone.-n    For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.-n    Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.-n    For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.-n    If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.-n    For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchantment can dispel it.-n    If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.-n    For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.-n    Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item---n    even if it's the recent recipient of the break enchantment spell.

-n
    Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage.-n    The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time).-n    Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.-n    You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed.-n    However, each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt.-n    You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).-n    If you are outdoors and in a stormy area--a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size; see the Monster Manual)---n    each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.-n    This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.

    Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.

    It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets.
    While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect.
    When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

    You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall.-n    When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant (see the Monster Manual).-n    The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands.-n    However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees.-n    If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed.-n    Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell.-n    The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.-n    Focus: The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared.-n    The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).-n    You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and carving of the staff.

    This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly; see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72).-n    -n    If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.-n    -n    The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way.-n    -n    You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed).-n    -n    An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but a charmed fighter, for example, might believe you if you assured him that the only chance to save your life is for him to hold back an onrushing red dragon for "just a few seconds".-n    -n    Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell.-n    You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

Duration: 7 rounds
Saving Throw: Will negates (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)
-n
    Chill metal makes metal extremely cold.-n    Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.-n    Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master's Guide).-n    An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.-n    A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled.-n    It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight.-n    The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.-n    On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.-n    The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration.-n    During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage.-n    In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.-n    Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.-n    For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage.-n    Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.-n    Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal.

    @Clairaudience/clairvoyance@ creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there.-n    You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known--a place familiar to you or an obvious one, such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees.-n    Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired.-n    Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it.-n    If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing.-n    If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the center of the spell's effect.-n    @Clairaudience/clairvoyance@ functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.-n    Arcane Focus: A small horn (for hearing) or a glass eye (for seeing).

Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
-n
    A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become confused.-n    This abjuration has four effects.-n    First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves.-n    Unlike protection from law, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.-n    Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.-n    Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from law does.-n    Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is confused for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the confusion spell, but against the save DC of cloak of chaos).-n    Focus: A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap of parchment from a chaotic text.-n    The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.

Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature.-n    If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement-n    (provided that the soul is free and willing to return; see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171).-n    The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life.-n    If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.-n    To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body.-n    The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (for example, by the gentle repose spell).-n    Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.-n    When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead.-n    The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original.-n    In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character).-n    If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails.-n    If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died.-n    The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.-n    A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.-n    Material Component: The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies (cost 1,000 gp).-n    Focus: Special laboratory equipment (cost 500 gp).

Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous.-n    These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save).-n    A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).-n    A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage).-n    Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.-n    Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.-n    Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.-n    Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying hives of giant ants, for example.-n    It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

    You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
    
    1st Round: Presence or absence of evil.
    
    2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
    
    3rd Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
    
    Aura Power: An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.
    
    For example, as indicated on the table, an evil outsider with 12 HD has an overwhelming aura of evil. A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1  round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower.

    Lingering Aura: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is  destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If detect evil is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them.

Range: Unlimited
Target: One creature or object
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.-n    -n    To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.

    Because magic is so powerful, so too is the ability to dispel magic.-n    You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell.-n    A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired.-n    Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic.-n    Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.-n    Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.-n    Thus, you can't use dispel magic to repair damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh.-n    In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.-n    You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel:One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell.-n    You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing-n    spell currently in effect on the object or creature.-n    The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.-n    For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets dispel magic on a drow who is under the effects of haste, mage armor, and bull's strength.-n    All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard.-n    Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the haste, mage armor, and bull's strength effects.-n    If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.-n    If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.-n    If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level.-n    If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own.-n    A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect.-n    An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed.-n    A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact).-n    Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.-n    You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.-n    Area Dispel:When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.-n    For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level.-n    If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks.-n    The creature's magic items are not affected.-n    For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures.-n    Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.-n    For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.-n    For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.-n    If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.-n    You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.-n    Counterspell:When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170).-n    Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Duration: Instantaneous
-n
    Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.-n    -n    For example, suppose the question is "Will we do well if we venture into the ruined temple of Erythnul?" The DM knows that a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a +1 shield lurks near the entrance but estimates that your party could beat the troll after a hard fight. Therefore the divination response might be: "Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth." In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. (For example, the troll could move away and take the treasure with it.)-n    -n    The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.-n    -n    As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.-n    -n    Material Component: Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp.

-n
    You can enchant an animal and direct it with simple commands such as "Attack", "Run", and "Fetch".-n    Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored.-n    Dominate animal establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature.-n    The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range.-n    You need not see the creature to control it.-n    You do not receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing.-n    Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension.-n    You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't do.-n    Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One humanoid
Duration: One day/level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.-n    If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.-n    If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here", "Go there", "Fight", and "@Stand@ still".-n    You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.-n    Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).-n    Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81).-n    Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.-n    By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you.-n    You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).-n    Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.-n    Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.-n    Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.-n    You need not see the subject to control it.-n    If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.-n    Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.

Duration: 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8.-n    This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one.-n    The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.-n    A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet.-n    This spell does not change the target's speed.-n    If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process.-n    If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.-n    All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell.-n    Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide).-n    Other magical properties are not affected by this spell.-n    Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.-n    This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.-n    Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell--an enlarged +1 sword still has only a +1 enhancement bonus, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, and so on.-n    Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of a humanoid that's still under the effect of the first casting.-n    Enlarge person counters and dispels reduce person.-n    Enlarge person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.-n    Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron.

    The affected creatures or objects fall slowly, though faster than feathers typically do.-n    Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a-n    fall froma few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect.-n    However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.-n    The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.-n    You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.-n    Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.-n    You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.-n    This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance.-n    If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.-n    (See the Dungeon Master's Guide for information on falling objects).-n    Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects.-n    It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

    The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale.-n    The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze spell.-n    Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale.-n    Thus, the subject could not find the way to "a forest where a green dragon lives" or "a hoard of platinum pieces", but it could find the exit to a labyrinth.-n    The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.-n    The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take.-n    For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding.-n    The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.-n    Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round.-n    This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).-n    Focus: A set of divination counters of the sort you favor---n    bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, or the like.

-n
    A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.-n    -n    You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.-n    -n    The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.-n    -n    Material Component: A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.

    This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another.-n    Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell.-n    Thus, if you are the subject of the spell, you would be warned in advance if a rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from a hiding place, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon.-n    You are never surprised or flat-footed.-n    In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself--duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on--and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.-n    This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.-n    When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature.-n    You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.-n    @Shout@ing a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.-n    The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.-n    Arcane Material Component: A hummingbird's feather.

Gate
Conjuration(Creation or Calling)

Components: V, S, XP

Effect: See text
Duration: Instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    Casting a gate spell has two effects.-n    First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.-n    Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.-n    The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you).-n    It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.-n    A gate has a front and a back.-n    Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.-n    Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect).-n    Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire.-n    Travelers need not join hands with you--anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported.-n    A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.-n    You could position a gate in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane.-n    Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.-n    You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.-n    Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect).-n    By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.-n    Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord.-n    This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures.-n    This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).-n    If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual--for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin--you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures.-n    You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level.-n    In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level.-n    A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled.-n    Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event.-n    An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous.-n    An uncontrolled beingmay return to its home plane at any time.-n    A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you.-n    Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.-n    Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help.-n    The creature departs at the end of the spell.-n    If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service.-n    The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards.-n    (Some creatures may want their payment in "livestock"-n    rather than in coin, which could involve complications).-n    Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward.-n    After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.-n    Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least.-n    At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.-n    Note:When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.-n    For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon.-n    XP Cost: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function).

-n
    A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you.-n    The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you.-n    While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.-n    The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.-n    If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as "Wait here" or "Defend this area against attack"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level.-n    A clever recipient can subvert some instructions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell.-n    If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores.-n    Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of - 8.-n    No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect.-n    The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas.-n    A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish.-n    Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Saving Throw: None
-n
    This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.-n    Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser geas), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest.-n    Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened.-n    These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest.-n    A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level.-n    Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do.-n    Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms.-n    Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size.-n    The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your level; see the table below.-n    The Monster Manual has game statistics for centipedes, spiders, and scorpions, as well as other kinds of vermin.-n    Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands ("Attack", "Defend", "Stop", and so forth).-n    Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand.-n    Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.-n    The DM can extend this spell's effects to other kinds of insects, arachnids, or other vermin, such as ants, bees, beetles, praying mantises, and wasps, if he so chooses.

    A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area.-n    -n    A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).-n    -n    The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not).-n    -n    The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item--a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.-n    -n    A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin. Material Component: A bit of pork rind or butter.

    The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked doors.-n    It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests.-n    It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut).-n    If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.-n    In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.-n    @Knock@ does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.-n    The effect is limited by the area.-n    A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot-n    door).-n    Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.-n    Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells.

    Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing.-n    If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4&#215;10 minutes.-n    If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).-n    If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).-n    During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.-n    When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind.-n    These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known.-n    If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.-n    As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are "legendary", as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.-n    Examples of legend lore results include the following.-n    A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones.-n    Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word 'Rudnogg'-n    on the lips".-n    A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: "Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life.-n    He waits patiently beneath the Forbidden @Mount@ain".-n    (The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain).-n    A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: "The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods.-n    Those who read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day".-n    (These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore).-n    Material Component: Incense worth at least 250 gp.-n    Focus: Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle.

    You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast--stone, timber, or (at worst) sod.-n    The floor is level, clean, and dry.-n    In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.-n    The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities).-n    Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants.-n    The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise--it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition.-n    The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone.-n    It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).-n    The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue.-n    In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell.-n    Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.-n    The secure shelter contains rude furnishings--eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.-n    Material Component: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood.-n    These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) if this benefit is to be included.-n    Focus: The focus of the alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if this benefit is to be included.

-n
    This spell makes a lock or small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps.-n    You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet.-n    Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists.-n    Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.-n    If another Leomund's trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.-n    Material Component: A piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to the trapped while the object is sprinkled with a special dust requiring 50 gp to prepare.-n    Lesser (Spell Name) Any spell whose name begins with lesser is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name.-n    Thus, the description of a lesser spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based.-n    Spell chains that have lesser spells in them include those based on the spells confusion, geas, globe of invulnerability, planar ally, planar binding, and restoration.

    All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either.-n    You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.-n    This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it.-n    A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward.-n    When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle.-n    The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries.-n    If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.-n    A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.-n    If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends.-n    The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can.-n    If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.-n    If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.-n    A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.-n    You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.-n    If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does.-n    The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.-n    The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.-n    You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.-n    Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check.-n    The DM makes this check secretly.-n    If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.-n    You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.-n    This task also takes 10 full minutes.-n    If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.-n    A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell.-n    The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level.-n    A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.-n    If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.-n    The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram--even a straw laid across it.-n    However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.-n    This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.-n    Arcane Material Component: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    By casting magic jar, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the magic jar), leaving your body lifeless.-n    Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar.-n    You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.-n    The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.-n    To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.-n    When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.-n    While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence).-n    You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures.-n    You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures.-n    In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.-n    (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy.-n    Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls).-n    For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy.-n    You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.-n    Attempting to possess a body is a fullround action.-n    It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.-n    You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save.-n    Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.-n    If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar.-n    You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.-n    The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities.-n    For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates.-n    A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.-n    You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.-n    The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.-n    As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body.-n    The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.-n    If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead).-n    If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die.-n    Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.-n    If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed).-n    If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).-n    Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host's location.-n    Focus: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.

Level: Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2, Adept 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal; see text
Target: You
Duration: 1 min./level (D)
-n
    Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack.-n    The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.-n    Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total).-n    These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you.-n    You can move into and through a mirror image.-n    When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image.-n    The figments may also move through each other.-n    The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.-n    Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.-n    Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment.-n    Any successful attack against an image destroys it.-n    An image's AC is 10 + your sizemodifier + your Dex modifier.-n    Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).-n    While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.-n    An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled.-n    If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect.-n    (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded).

Spell Resistance: No
-n
    By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like).-n    On casting the spell, you choose another object within range.-n    For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object.-n    (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect).-n    Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save.-n    For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth.-n    This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like).

-n
    You become invisible (as improved invisibility, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as major image, a figment) appears.-n    You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away.-n    The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting).-n    You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible.-n    You and the figment can then move in different directions.-n    The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.-n    The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds.-n    After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity (for instance, fleeing down a hallway) until the duration expires.-n    The improved invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

Modify Memory
Enchantment(Compulsion)[Mind-Affecting]

Target: One living creature
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.-n    -n    * Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced.-n    -n    This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest, suggestion, or similar spells.-n    -n    * Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.-n    -n    For instance, it could recall every word from a 5-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book.-n    -n    * Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.-n    -n    * Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.-n    -n    Casting the spell takes 1 round.-n    If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject.-n    If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.-n    A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations.-n    An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much it enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.-n    More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that it ever saw you or your party.-n    The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject.

-n
    All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined.-n    That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item.-n    An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher.-n    You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field.-n    If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined.-n    Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items.-n    Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities.-n    (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish).-n    Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

-n
    You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched.-n    A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.-n    For example, if a poison has dealt 3 points of Constitution damage to a character and threatens to deal more damage later, this spell prevents the future damage but does not repair the damage already done.-n    The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell.-n    Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration--the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.-n    This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster's option.-n    Arcane Material Component: A bit of charcoal.

    Otiluke's Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area.-n    An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8).-n    If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10-foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet).-n    This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level.-n    Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice.-n    Attempting to break free is a full-round action.-n    A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.-n    You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish.-n    Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge (see page 176).-n    You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect).-n    Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.-n    Focus: A small crystal sphere.

-n
    A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere.-n    The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration.-n    The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, a disintegrate spell, or a targeted dispel magic spell.-n    These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject.-n    Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally.-n    The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.-n    Material Component: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.

-n
    This spell functions like Otiluke's resilient sphere, with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless.-n    Anything contained within an Otiluke's telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight.-n    You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less.-n    The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.-n    You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere.-n    You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell.-n    If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round.-n    If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell's duration expires, or you begin concentrating again.-n    If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration.-n    The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.-n    You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.-n    Material Component: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets.

Duration: 1d4+1 rounds
Saving Throw: None

    The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping.-n    The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place.-n    The effect imposes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds.-n    The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn.

    The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for details). If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that you never learn what is possible except by the success or failure of your research.

    This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials.-n    The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage.-n    You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit.-n    If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door.-n    This counts as two uses of the door.-n    The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it.-n    Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease.-n    A gem of true seeing or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use.-n    A phase door is subject to dispel magic.-n    If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect.-n    You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door.-n    Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.-n    They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.-n    Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.-n    Phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Conjuration(Calling)[see text]
Level: Cleric 4
Components: V, S, DF, XP
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: One called elemental or outsider of 6 HD or less
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice.-n    If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment.-n    If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).-n    You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you.-n    Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon).-n    You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.-n    The creature called requires a payment for its services.-n    This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals.-n    Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services.-n    The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.-n    A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called.-n    For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD.-n    A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.-n    A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift.-n    Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature).-n    However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment.-n    For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value.-n    At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).-n    Note:When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.-n    For example, a lesser planar ally is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental.-n    XP Cost: 100 XP.

    Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range.-n    The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.-n    To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward.-n    The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated.-n    If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.-n    The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw.-n    If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell.-n    If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).-n    The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier).-n    It can try each method once per day.-n    If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.-n    A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel.-n    You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure.-n    If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare.-n    You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward.-n    You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check.-n    The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward.-n    If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service.-n    New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours.-n    This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell.-n    Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.-n    If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.-n    Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.-n    The creature might later seek revenge.-n    If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as "Wait here" or "Defend this area against attack"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.-n    Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.-n    When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.-n    For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental.

-n
    This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another.-n    The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state.-n    The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines.-n    Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form.-n    If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.-n    Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.-n    For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death.-n    If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed.-n    Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide.-n    In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations.-n    A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell.-n    Magic items aren't affected by this spell.-n    This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine.-n    It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.-n    This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.-n    Arcane Material Component:Mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.

    @Prestidigitation@s are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice.-n    Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.-n    The effects are minor and have severe limitations.-n    A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.-n    It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.-n    It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.-n    It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.-n    @Prestidigitation@ can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.-n    The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.-n    Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.-n    Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.-n    Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.-n    Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.

    This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures.-n    It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot.-n    The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.-n    First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves.-n    Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.-n    Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person).-n    The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect.-n    If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.-n    Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.-n    This second effect works regardless of alignment.-n    Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures.-n    This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.-n    Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect.-n    The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.-n    Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.-n    Arcane Material Component: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

    You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called "eyes") equal to 1d4 + your caster level.-n    These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell.-n    Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.-n    While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot.-n    Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier.-n    It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings.-n    An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.-n    When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words.-n    Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well.-n    A sample command: "Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures".-n    The phrase "Surround me" directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you.-n    As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate.-n    In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous.-n    A "peasant" that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return.-n    Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring.-n    Another sample command: "Spread out and search the town for Arweth.-n    Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return".-n    The phrase "Spread out" directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions.-n    In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him.-n    Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature.-n    The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions.-n    In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand.-n    Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence.-n    It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images.-n    After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.-n    If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.-n    However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.-n    The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you.-n    Dispel magic can destroy eyes.-n    Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel.-n    Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.-n    Material Component: A handful of crystal marbles.

Duration: 24 hours
Saving Throw: None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation.-n    When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area.-n    The illusion created must be stated in general terms.-n    Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game.-n    You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area.-n    You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible.-n    Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.-n    Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed.-n    Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created.-n    A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance.-n    Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen.-n    Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another.-n    Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

    When you cast sepia snake sigil, a small symbol appears in the text of one written work such as a book, scroll, or map.-n    The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long.-n    When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.-n    Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.-n    The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike.-n    If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise.-n    If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.-n    While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells.-n    It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings.-n    It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury.-n    However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.-n    The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical.-n    A dispel magic can remove the sigil.-n    An erase spell destroys the entire page of text.-n    Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells-n    that hide or garble text, such as secret page.-n    Material Component: 500 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores.

-n
    You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces.-n    Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.-n    Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.-n    Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.-n    Spells that deal damage, such as Melf's acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save.-n    Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack.-n    If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur.-n    Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.-n    In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not.-n    Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.-n    Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.-n    A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy).-n    It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses.-n    Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.-n    (Roll for each use and each affected character separately).-n    Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).-n    A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.-n    Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

    To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination.-n    You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow.-n    The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.-n    You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.-n    In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane.-n    Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.-n    Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.-n    It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.-n    Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10&#215;100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint.-n    If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10&#215;1,000 feet in the same direction.-n    If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).-n    Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.-n    The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.-n    Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.-n    They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).-n    Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened.-n    Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped.-n    You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM's option).-n    Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected.-n    Earth or stone creatures are not affected.-n    A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells.-n    A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.-n    Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.-n    Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.-n    For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.-n    While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.-n    Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.-n    A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle.-n    However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

    You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it.-n    You may ask one question per two caster levels.-n    Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.-n    The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any).-n    Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive.-n    If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.-n    If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails.-n    You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond.-n    A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.-n    This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed).-n    It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse.-n    The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive.-n    The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.-n    Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.-n    This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

    The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have.-n    The spells must be of 4th level or lower.-n    The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells.-n    Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply.-n    Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures.-n    It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.-n    Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect.-n    Thus, a creature given immunity to lightning bolt is still vulnerable to shocking grasp or chain lightning.-n    A creature can have only one spell immunity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.

-n
    Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster.-n    The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target.-n    Effect and area spells are not affected.-n    Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells.-n    Thus, a charm person spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a fireball could not be turned back, and neither could inflict critical wounds.-n    From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning.-n    The DM secretly rolls the exact number.-n    When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left.-n    When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned.-n    The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through.-n    For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage.-n    For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected.-n    For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by a magic missile spell heightened to 4th level, you would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster.-n    You would take one-forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage.-n    If you were targeted by a wizard's fear spell (also a 4th-level spell) in the same situation, you would have a one in four (25%) chance to be affected by the spell, while the caster would have a three in four (75%) chance to be affected.-n    If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by spell turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created.-n    Roll randomly to determine the result.-n    Arcane Material Component: A small silver mirror.

Symbol of Death
Necromancy[Death]
Level: Cleric 8, Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 0 ft.; see text
Effect: One symbol
Duration: See text
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
-n
    This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface.-n    When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150.-n    The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.-n    Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.-n    Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.-n    A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.-n    Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).-n    To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.-n    Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.-n    As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.-n    Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).-n    Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.-n    In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.-n    Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.-n    You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.-n    Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.-n    You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.-n    These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.-n    Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.-n    Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.-n    For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.-n    When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.-n    Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.-n    If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.-n    You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.-n    Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.-n    Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.-n    Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.-n    Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.-n    You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.-n    Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.-n    Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.-n    A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.-n    An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.-n    @Destruction@ of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.-n    @Symbol@ of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.-n    A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.-n    Note:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.-n    A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.-n    The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.-n    Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each.

    This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level.-n    Interplanar travel is not possible.-n    You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.-n    You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels.-n    A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.-n    All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.-n    As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you.-n    Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.-n    You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination.-n    You can't simply teleport to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it.-n    The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works.-n    Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.-n    To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the @Teleport@ table.-n    Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.-n    Familiarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.-n    "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour.-n    "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.-n    "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.-n    "False destination" is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy's sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground).-n    When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.-n    On Target: You appear where you want to be.-n    Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.-n    Distance off target is 1d10&#215;1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.-n    For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target.-n    That's 18 miles, in this case.-n    The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth.-n    If you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.-n    Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.-n    A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory.-n    Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.-n    If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.-n    Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled".-n    You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.-n    For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.-n    Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

-n
    This spell functions like teleport, except that it teleports an object, not you.-n    Creatures and magical forces (such as a delayed blast fireball bead) cannot be teleported.-n    If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane.-n    In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved.-n    A successful targeted dispel magic spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.

Conjuration(Teleportation)
Level: Sorcerer 7, Wizard 7, Travel 7
Components: 
-n
    This spell functions like @teleport@, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target.-n    In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting (such as a detailed description from someone else or a particularly precise map).-n    If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location.-n    Interplanar travel is not possible.

    You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot.-n    Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it.-n    The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.-n    The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice.-n    If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way, such as by placing it on a raised platform.-n    @Teleport@ation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell.-n    A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.-n    Note:Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable.-n    A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it.-n    The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.-n    Material Component: Amber dust to cover the area of the circle (cost 1,000 gp).

Transmutation[Earth]
Level: Druid 5, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Duration: Permanent; see text
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud.-n    If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud.-n    Magical stone is not affected by the spell.-n    The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.-n    A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.-n    Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.-n    Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.-n    If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet.-n    For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud.-n    Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet.-n    The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.-n    Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.-n    However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.-n    The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance--but not necessarily its form.-n    Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.-n    The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.-n    Arcane Material Component: Clay and water.

-n
    You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two.-n    The entry plant must be alive.-n    The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive.-n    If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance ("an oak tree one hundred miles due north of here"), and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location.-n    If a particular destination plant is desired (the oak tree outside your druid grove, for instance), but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.-n    You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.-n    You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.-n    Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.-n    All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.-n    You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures such as shambling mounds and treants.-n    The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree.

Trap the Soul
Conjuration(Summoning)
Level: Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8

Casting Time: 1 standard action or see text
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: Permanent; see text
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: Yes; see text
-n
    Trap the soul forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem.-n    The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform.-n    If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed.-n    Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.-n    Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.-n    Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject.-n    This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect.-n    If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2.-n    If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.-n    Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap.-n    To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled.-n    A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object.-n    As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.-n    Material Component: Before the actual casting of trap the soul, you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 HD creature).-n    If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted.-n    (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched.-n    Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice).-n    Focus (Trigger Object Only): If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed.

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
-n
    By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs.-n    The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature.-n    To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree.-n    While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected.-n    You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet.-n    You are immune to critical hits while in tree form.-n    All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.-n    You can dismiss tree shape as a free action (instead of as a standard action).

-n
    You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree.-n    The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours.-n    By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into.-n    You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.-n    You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree).-n    The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree.-n    This means that in a thick oak forest, a 10th-level druid-n    could make ten transports over the course of 10 rounds, traveling as far as 30,000 feet (about 6 miles) in doing so.-n    Each transport is a full-round action.-n    You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends.-n    If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

-n
    This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected.-n    A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures.-n    Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created.-n    Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed.-n    A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.-n    Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).-n    Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.-n    Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears.-n    The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.-n    It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet).-n    The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored.-n    A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.-n    The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like.-n    Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.-n    Creatures can hit the wall automatically.-n    A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.-n    If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.-n    Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains.-n    Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).-n    Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.-n    Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius.-n    The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.-n    Material Component: A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.

Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being.-n    This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so.-n    The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.-n    It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.-n    A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.-n    You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.-n    Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.-n    A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.-n    If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.-n    If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it.-n    The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed.-n    Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly.-n    A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over.-n    Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.-n    Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage.-n    The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.-n    Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.-n    Material Component: A small piece of sheet iron plus gold dust worth 50 gp (1 pound of gold dust).

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Stone wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces.-n    It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.-n    A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.-n    You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.-n    The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.-n    Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire.-n    The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.-n    It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.-n    For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.-n    This requirement reduces the spell's area by half.-n    Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares.-n    The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.-n    Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.-n    Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.-n    A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached.-n    If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.-n    It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.-n    Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.-n    Arcane Material Component: A small block of granite.

Wall of Thorns
Conjuration(Creation)
Level: Druid 5, Plant 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Wall of thorny brush, up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
-n
    A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger.-n    Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC.-n    Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation.-n    (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall).-n    You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level.-n    This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.-n    Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action.-n    For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed).-n    For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round.-n    Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above.-n    A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.-n    Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside.-n    In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends.-n    Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.-n    A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons.-n    Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work.-n    Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.-n    Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.

    @Web@ creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands.-n    These strands trap those caught in them.-n    The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.-n    These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points--floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like--or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears.-n    Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers.-n    Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.-n    Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.-n    If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below).-n    If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check.-n    Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly.-n    Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.-n    The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.-n    If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover.-n    If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150).-n    The strands of a web spell are flammable.-n    A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs.-n    Any fire--a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth--can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round.-n    All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.-n    @Web@ can be made permanent with a permanency spell.-n    A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.-n    Material Component: A bit of spider web.

    This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round.-n    You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like.-n    Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you.-n    The cyclone always moves during your turn.-n    If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds--possibly endangering you or your allies--and then dissipates.-n    (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range).-n    Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage.-n    A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed.-n    You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

    You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot.-n    The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location.-n    (It can't pass through walls, for instance).-n    A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location.-n    It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound.-n    Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it.-n    The wind then dissipates.-n    You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air.-n    You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.-n    When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered.-n    As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

-n
    You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the gaseous form spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed.-n    You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.-n    Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability.-n    If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability.-n    Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent.-n    If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.-n    A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form.-n    Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form).-n    As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.-n    For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes.-n    This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

    @Wish@ is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits.-n    -n    A wish can produce any one of the following effects.-n    -n    * Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.-n    -n    * Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.-n    -n    * Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.-n    -n    * Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.-n    -n    * Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.-n    -n    * Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.-n    -n    * Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.-n    -n    * Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.-n    -n    * Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.-n    -n    * Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wish, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.-n    -n    * Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.-n    -n    * Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.-n    -n    You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a wish gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment). For example, wishing for a staff of the magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff's current owner. @Wish@ing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could "live" indefinitely.-n    -n    Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).-n    -n    Material Component: When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.-n    -n    XP Cost: The minimum XP cost for casting wish is 5,000 XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.
